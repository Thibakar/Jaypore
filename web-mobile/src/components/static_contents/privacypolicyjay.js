For example, we collect Personal information such as your name, username, phone number, credit card and other billing information, email address, shipping address and your friends' email addresses( which we will only use in order to invite them to use the service), and your third-party account credientials (for example, your log-in credientials for Facebook).

We may anonymize your personal information so that you cannot be individually identified and provide that anonymize information to our partners.
                                 For example, we allow advertisers to choose the demographic information of users who will see their  advertisements and agree that we may use any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally  identifiable from to allow our advertisers to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements.

We may provide this aggregate usage information to our partners; our partners may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Website, so that our partners, too, can endeavor to provide you with an optimal online experience, For example, we may place a cookie on your device that records what products you have viewed on your website, and then provide that information, in non-personally-identifiable form, to a third party website, to allow such website to show you ads for similar products that are available from us or from third parties.<br></br>

Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacon from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from  their site.
